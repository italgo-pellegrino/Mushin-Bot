# Mushin-Bot

This Discord bot was created to serve the needs of a small gaming community active on Discord. Specifically, the community was playing "Blade & Soul Revolution," a game where field bosses spawn on a timer that starts as soon as the boss is defeated.

To help the community keep track of when these bosses would respawn, the bot was implemented. Users could enter the time of the boss's defeat in Discord, and the bot would send a notification 5 minutes before the boss respawned. This allowed the community to work together and capture all of the field bosses.

Over the course of approximately two months, more than 100 players used the bot daily to help coordinate their efforts and make sure they didn't miss any field bosses. However, as interest in the game began to decline, so did the use of the bot.
